I imported the csv into pandas to convert the tripduration to a datetime format to allow for interesting visualizations.

Tableau allows for some really fun maps and interactive datamodels. I really enjoyed this program and have gotten it installed on my computer at work, but have been too swamped to use it yet! I'll try to interpret more of the data as I move a long. Hopefully in the next few weeks I can release a few of my accounts to other people so I can focus on the bigger problems with my newest account. Handpicked and fast forwarding into a new era of confusion.
