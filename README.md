I imported the csv into pandas to convert the tripduration to a datetime format to allow for interesting visualizations.

## Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Tableau.public

Tableau allows for some really fun maps and interactive datamodels. I really enjoyed this program and have even gotten it installed on my computer at work, but have been too swamped to use it yet! Hopefully in the next few weeks I can release a few of my accounts to other people so I can focus on the bigger problems with my newest account. My latest account has been taking more time than expected. Sometimes change moves slowly when organizations re-structure. 
Handpicked for a project that feels like a fast forward into a new era of confusion for all parties. But I digress. 


## Tableau Story

The above link shows my hosted tableau info and the assorted heatmaps, and Active stations map which I've colorcoded by station popularity & is filterable by Gender, Female, Male & Person. To me these are important factors to consider in ensureing the bike share stations are placed in safe & well lit areas where people have clear vision. 

The density maps also point to a trend of centralization. Bikes tend to be more popular when there are many stations to go to. The program expectedly tapers off near the edges. 

## Active Stations by Gender

## Active Times by gender
Active times by gender really allows us to notice trends, we see here that Men tend to use the bikes and more actively at late hours.
